# GravityCompensationCode
Code required to run gravity compensation on the Exo-H3. This code was the framework used during my MEng experiment, some changes were made to facilitate the experiment and TCP/IP . This code is designed to be used on an Exo-H3.

Select the method of gravity compensation of your choice, add the source to the path and run the main script. Ensure your Exo-H3 is connected by CAN-Bus communication
PreRequisites

MATLAB's Vehicle Network Toolbox
An exoskeleton will probably be handy
EMG sensors in order to trigger data (this can be removed)
